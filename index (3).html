                    <p class="padding-Font">Are you using Instagram! For several months or years? Unfortunately, not
                        getting answers on <strong> "How do you make money off Instagram?" </strong>
                        <br><br>
                        Oh Really! Can you earn money from Instagram? I think you should read this full post.
                        <br><br>
                        Well, Instagram is one of the most popular Social platforms, now used by millions of people.
                        Since it gained <strong> 100 million </strong> monthly active users, so it’s no surprise that
                        the brands are
                        investing their money on Instagram to market their businesses online. Today Instagram ranks 7th
                        on the top 15 social networking sites, up to 100 million unique monthly users, and over 300
                        million active people are posting videos, photos, and contents daily.
                        <br><br>
                        Now it’s time to take advantage of your Instagram profile.
                        <br><br>
                        How many followers do you have on your Instagram profile? Comment down… 🙂
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="padding-Font" style="padding: 10px;"> <strong> What Do You Need, before you make money
                            off Instagram?
                        </strong> </h3>
                    <p class="padding-Font">Yeah! Do you know that’s an essential step before making money off
                        Instagram? But what you need to do! You need to attract more and more followers. You can easily
                        do this by building your <strong> business Instagram account </strong> professionally.
                        <br>
                    <h4 class="padding-Font" style="padding: 10px;"> <strong> Create your own business account:
                        </strong> </h4>
                    <p class="padding-Font"> There are two options, by which you can create Instagram accounts. </p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 100px; font-size: 25px; margin-top: -40px;">
                        <li>Personal account</li>
                        <li>Business account</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class="padding-Font">However, I recommend you to go with a business account, as it has many great
                        features.</p>

                    <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"> <strong> Fill out your bio correctly: </strong></h4>
                    <p class="padding-Font">
                        Filling your bio is an essential step. You have to add your info, contact details, your posts’
                        category, with a couple of hashtags to ensure you’re easily findable by the right kind of
                        followers.
                        <strong> +point: </strong> Add your site link, product links with two lines of description.
                        Believe me or not, your
                        conversation rate will increase instantly. In short, I can say that your bio section is the best
                        place where you can market your products and services, and can get good results quickly, with
                        the 60-80% conversation rate.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"> <strong> Post engaging content daily: </strong></h4>
                    <p class="padding-Font">What many people make mistakes! They do not post eye-catching content. As a
                        result, they failed to grow their followers.
                        No rush of followers! Means zero sales.
                        So post attractive info in the form of videos and content regularly. I am sure you will grow
                        more quickly. Also, add the relevant hashtag that will help you to grow organically.</p>
                    <h4 style="margin-left: 40px;"> <strong> Create engagement with your Followers: </strong></h4>
                    <p class="padding-Font">You can’t generate sales without attracting your audience towards your
                        brand. What you have to do to create more engagement?

                    <h3 class="padding-Font" style="padding: 10px; font-size: 30px;"> <strong> Generate Affiliate sales
                        </strong> </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p class="padding-Font">You can generate affiliate sales from your Instagram profile by doing
                        Affiliate marketing. When
                        you promote someone’s products, so you will be paid for every sale that you will generate. It is
                        so simple.
                        <br><br>
                        Just join brands affiliate, according to your topic, niche, and category. They will give you a
                        specific URL to track your insights. And by promoting that link, you can earn on every sale
                        (from $1 to $200+ on every purchase, based on the products you are selling).
                        <br><br>
                        It’s easy to join affiliate companies. Let’s suppose, if you can write short content or
                        infographics on different mobile brands and models, then you should promote affiliate links of
                        new mobile phones with a short review.</p>
